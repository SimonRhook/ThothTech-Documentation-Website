## Code Style and Formatting Guide

This guide aims to introduce new team members to some standard practices for contributing to
splashkit, such as varable declarations, formatting across languages and general do's and dont's

## Naming Conventions

These are general naming conventions for variables, functions, namespaces and more that should be
used when creating usage examples for SplashKit.

### Variable declarations

Variable declarations for SplashKit usage examples should be in the following format:

- For Python and C++ we use `snake_case`
- For C# OOP and Top-Level we use `camelCase`

| Do                                    | Don't                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Use descriptive variable names        | Use `i`, `x`, `val` in main logic   |
| Use variables for multiple use values | Declare a variable for one time use |
| Use proper types for variables        | Use types such as `var` and `float` |

### Example declarations

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Declare a variable with snake_case
    string variable_name = "This is snake case";
    return 0;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

<Tabs syncKey="csharp-style">
<TabItem label="Top-level Statements">

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

// Declare a variable with camelCase
string variableName = "this is an example of camelCase";
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Object-Oriented">

```csharp
using SplashKitSDK;

namespace ReadingText
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            // Declare a variable with camelCase
            string variableName = "this is an example of camelCase";

        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
from splashkit import *

# declare a variable with snake_case
string variable_name = "This is snake case"

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Function and Methods

When calling and naming functions and methods using SplashKit we do the following:

- C++ / Python: `snake_case` (e.g `draw_rectangle()`)
- C#: `PascalCase` (e.g. `DrawRectangle()`)

### Namespaces in C#

The namespace for a usage example in C# should always be the function being demonstrated with
example added on the end, also written in Pascal case.

#### Example:

- `namespace DrawRectangleExample`

### Window Names

When using windows to display any graphics the window name should be a description of what is
happening on the window rather than the name of the function you are displaying.

#### Example:

- Do (`"Colourful Starburst"`):
  ***
  ![Good window name](images/goodname.png)
- Don't (`"Draw Line"`):
  ***
  ![Bad window name](images/badname.png)

## Code Comments

Code comments should be used to explain the _why_ behind code, not the _what_. Code comments should
be clear and concise

A good Comment should explain the intent or purpose A bad comment will state the obvious

| Do                                            | Don't                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `// Draw rectangle to window`                 | `// Call the DrawRectangle function`                                             |
| `// Wait for user input`                      | `// Hold program to wait for user to press any key before the program continues` |
| Use comments for complex or non-obvious logic | Use comments to repeat code literally                                            |

#### Example

```csharp
// Good comment
if (playerHealth <= 0)
{
    // End the game if the player runs out of health
    WriteLine("Game Over");
}

// Bad Comment
if (playerHealth <= 0)
{
    // Call WriteLine when health reaches 0
    WriteLine("Game Over");
}
```

## General things to avoid

As SplashKit usage examples are targeted to beginners, so it's important to keep the code as simple
and readable as possible. Avoid using advanced features such as:

- Ternary operators (condition ? value1 : value2) - Stick to traditional if/else statements
- Lambda expressions - Keep function logic clear and named
- Infinite Loops such as `while(true)` - instead always use a loop condition that is defined by a
  boolean function (e.g. `while(!quit_requested)`)
