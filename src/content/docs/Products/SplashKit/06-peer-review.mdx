In SplashKit, peer reviews are an essential part of maintaining high-quality code. The Peer-Review
Checklist provided below is required for every pull request and ensures that all contributions meet
a consistent standard across the project. This checklist covers essential aspects like code quality,
functionality, and testing.

However, we recognize that every feature or task is different, and it’s difficult to capture all
potential review points in a single checklist. That’s why we’ve also included a set of Peer-Review
Prompts. These prompts are not mandatory but serve as a resource to guide the peer-review
discussion. Since peer reviews should always be collaborative, these prompts help ensure that the
review process is conversational and thorough, encouraging reviewers to think critically and explore
areas that may not be immediately obvious.

Remember, the goal of peer reviews is not only to verify the quality of the code but also to foster
a collaborative environment where we improve together.

As a reviewer, it is _your_ responsibility to move the Planner Card to the next column once approval
has been given.

## How to Perform a Peer Review

To maintain code quality and ensure smooth integration of new features, it’s essential to follow
these steps when reviewing a PR in the SplashKit Starlight repository.

<Steps>

1. ### Check for Upstream Branches

   Start by verifying whether the upstream branches are already added to your local repository. This
   is necessary to ensure that you can fetch PRs from the original repository for review.

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   If the output does not show `upstream` linked to the main repository, you’ll need to add it in
   the next step.

2. ### Add Upstream Branches (if not present)

   If the upstream branch is missing, add it manually. Replace `<repo-name>` with the exact name of
   the repository.

   ```shell
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/thoth-tech/<repo-name>.git
   ```

   #### Example: Adding the `splashkit.io-starlight` Repository

   For the `splashkit.io-starlight` repository, the command will be:

   ```shell
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight.git
   ```

3. ### Verify Upstream Branches

   Confirm that the upstream branch has been added correctly by running:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the main project repository) listed.

4. ### Pull the PR into a New Branch

   To review a PR, you will fetch it into a new local branch. Locate the ID/number of the PR on
   GitHub, and use this number in the following command. Replace `ID` with the PR number and
   `PR-branch-name` with a name that represents the PR purpose.

   ```shell
   git fetch upstream pull/ID/head:PR-branch-name
   ```

   #### Example: Fetching PR #7 that Adds a "New Feature"

   ```shell
   git fetch upstream pull/7/head:test-new-feature
   ```

5. ### Checkout the New Branch

   Switch to the newly created branch to start reviewing the PR.

   ```shell
   git checkout PR-branch-name
   ```

6. ### Review the Code

   Now that you are on the PR branch, start by reviewing the code to check for:

   - **Code Quality**: Confirm that the code aligns with the project’s coding standards and
     guidelines. Look for clean, well-organised, and readable code.
   - **Functionality**: Verify that the changes achieve the intended purpose and work as described.
   - **Testing**: Check for the presence of adequate tests, including unit and integration tests
     where necessary.
   - **Documentation**: Ensure any new features or updates are documented, with clear comments for
     any complex sections.

   Refer to the pull request template as you go through these checks to confirm that all required
   fields are covered.

7. ### Test the Changes Locally

   After the code review, run the project locally to verify that the new feature or bug fix works as
   expected. This can include:

   - Running any test suites that come with the project.
   - Manually checking if the new functionality behaves correctly and does not introduce any bugs.
   - Ensuring the changes do not break other parts of the project.

8. ### Provide Constructive Feedback

   After reviewing and testing, leave constructive feedback directly on the PR on GitHub. Highlight
   both positive aspects and areas for improvement.

   - Use specific comments on code lines or sections where changes are required.
   - Make sure to explain why a change is needed to help the author learn and understand.
   - Be courteous and professional, focusing on improving the code and maintaining high project
     standards.

9. ### Approve or Request Changes

   Once you’ve completed your review:

   - **Approve** if everything meets the project’s standards and the code works as expected.
   - **Request Changes** if the code requires adjustments before it can be merged. Clearly outline
     the changes required.

   In both cases, document your decision and leave detailed notes to assist the author.

### Review Guidelines for Specific File Types

Different file types require different levels of attention during the review process. Here's what to
look for when reviewing each type of file:

#### `.mdx` Files

- **Content Accuracy**: Ensure that the content is clear and accurate. Double-check for any errors
  in the documentation or guides.
- **Frontmatter**: Ensure the frontmatter (`title`, `description`, etc.) is correctly filled out.
- **Component Usage**: Verify that components such as `LinkCard`, `CardGrid`, or others are being
  used appropriately within the `.mdx` files.

#### `.css` Files

- **Consistency**: Check that the styles align with the **Styling Guide** and maintain a consistent
  use of variables (e.g., colours, fonts, spacing).
- **Accessibility**: Review for accessibility considerations, such as whether animations are
  disabled for users who prefer reduced motion, and whether contrast ratios meet **WCAG 2.1 AA**
  standards.
- **Naming Conventions**: Ensure that CSS class names follow a consistent naming pattern.

#### `.jsx`/`.tsx` Files

- **Functionality**: Make sure the interactive components (e.g., sliders, forms) work as expected
  and meet the requirements of the task.
- **Performance**: Look for unnecessary re-renders or other performance concerns.
- **Code Style**: Ensure the code follows **React/JSX** best practices and any project-specific
  linting rules.

#### `.astro` Files

- **Structure**: Ensure the page or component is well-structured and follows the **Astro standards**
  for component and page creation.
- **Reusability**: Look for opportunities to refactor repetitive code into reusable components.
