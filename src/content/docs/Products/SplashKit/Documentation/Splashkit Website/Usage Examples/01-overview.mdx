### What are Usage Examples?

Usage examples demonstrate a specific Splashkit function within a simple, small program. The goal is
to keep the program minimal while clearly showing how the function works.

For instance, the `write_line` example on the Splashkit site found
[here](https://splashkit.io/api/terminal/#write-line), clicking on the `See Code Example` shows how
the `write_line` function works, with a brief title of the program, program code, and a screenshot
of the output.

The following pages cover all the steps to create, submit, and review usage examples for the
Splashkit website.

## Steps to Completing a Usage Example

<Steps>

1. ### Choose a Planner Card or Idea

   Pick an existing planner card that matches a SplashKit function, or create a unique example.

   Make sure the idea clearly demonstrates the function in a practical or visually interesting way.

2. ### Develop a Demonstrative Program

   Write a simple program to illustrate the function’s use. Focus on clarity and simplicity,
   ensuring that the code is easy to follow and that it showcases the function effectively.

3. ### Write the Program in Multiple Languages

   - **C++**: Implement the example with standard C++ practices, providing a version using SplashKit
     and one without SplashKit (Beyond SplashKit).
     > **Note:** [Beyond SplashKit](https://splashkit.io/beyond-splashkit/projects/) is designed to
     > support students as they advance in their programming journey, helping them transition from
     > relying on SplashKit's pre-built functions to writing more advanced programs without
     > SplashKit. It encourages students to step outside its framework by independently creating
     > similar functionalities.
   - **C#**: Provide both a version using top-level statements and an Object-Oriented (OOP) version.
   - **Python**: Write a Python version that is straightforward and reflects the same functionality.

4. ### Create a Title for the example

   - Think of a title that describes the overall functionality of the program.
   - Be creative with this title. It should not be the name of the function, or use the word
     "Example".

5. ### Capture Output of Program

   Run the program in any of the languages to capture the details of the program running.

   You might do this with a screenshot, screen recording converted to a GIF, or an audio recording.

   | Output Format    | Accepted File Type | Example of when to use                                    |
   | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Screenshots      | `.png` file        | Simple program without any user inputs or animations.     |
   | Screen Recording | `.gif` file        | The program has user inputs or animations to demonstrate. |
   | Audio Recording  | `.webm` file       | The program include audio sounds.                         |

6. ### Add Files to the Correct Folder in the SplashKit Repository

   - Copy your files into the appropriate folder within the `splashkit.io-starlight` repository.
   - Ensure file names and directory paths are consistent with SplashKit’s structure.

7. ### Submit a Pull Request for Usage Examples

   Follow the steps in the
   [Pull Requests for Usage Examples guide](/products/splashkit/05-pull-request-template/).

   Use the provided PR template, describe your example clearly, and attach explanations and
   screenshots to the pull request.
