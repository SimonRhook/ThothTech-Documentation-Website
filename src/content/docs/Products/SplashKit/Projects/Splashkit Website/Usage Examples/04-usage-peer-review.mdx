## Peer Reviewing a Usage Example

Doing a peer review for usage examples follows the same process as the
[peer review guide](/products/splashkit/06-peer-review). However, you
will need to follow the steps for reviewing usage examples.

When reviewing an example, follow these steps:

### 1. Test the code

Compile/run each code file on your machine.

- Are there any errors?
- Are there any warnings?
- Does the program run as expected?

### 2. Analyse the effectiveness

Consider the function being demonstrated and how it might be used by a SplashKit user.

- Does the code example demonstrate the usefulness of the function?
- Or, do the code example give more insight into how the function works?
- Is the example simple enough for an SIT102 or SIT771 student to follow, while still being an
  interesting example?

### 3. Compare and analyse the code

Check the structure and functionality of the code in each language.

- Does the sequence of code match for all code files?
- Do the code comments match across all code files?
- Does the code follow the
  [style guide](/products/splashkit/projects/splashkit-website/usage-examples/05-usage-example-style-guide)
  requirements?
- Is the Object Oriented C# code using the Object Oriented format where possible/relevant?
- Is the python code using the correct function names? (These function names will often differ from
  other languages due to python not handling function overloads)

### 4. Test in localhost

Check the example displays correctly in your local development environment.

- Does the website build successfully with `npm run build`?
- Does the example display under the correct function when previewing the website with
  `npm run preview`?
- Is the correct function highlighted in the example code?

### 5. Request changes

Add your review comments on the pull request on GitHub.

- Add comments for individual lines, or groups of lines in the code files. This helps the original
  contributor to understand exactly what the issue is related to.
- Use professional language, and be polite but assertive.
- Include the correct version of code where relevant, or any suggested improvements.
- Ask questions if something is confusing or unclear.

:::note

**First Peer Review:**

- It is _very unlikely_ that you will approve a pull request on first review without any changes.
- We all miss things in our own code, which is why peer reviews are so important.

**Second Peer Review:**

- This review is more likely to be able to be approved without changes being requested.
- However, it is important to check that the first reviewer did not miss anything that _should have
  been found_ in the first review.
- You might also have experience that allows you to consider other aspects that the first reviewer
  would not have noticed.

### 6. Continue discussion about changes on the pull request

Check for replies on the pull request from the original contributor.

- These comments might be requesting more information about your suggested changes, so it is
  important to respond quickly.
- Discussions may include some debate on the best way forward. Be open to the ideas suggested by the
  other person, and include evidence to back up your reasoning.
- If needed, either the reviewer or the original contributor can reach out to your Mentor to help
  decide what the outcome should be.
- Check for a comment from the original contributor that the requested changes have been made.

### 7. Review the pull request again

Repeat steps 1 - 4 above.

- It is important to review the pull request thoroughly to ensure that the changes have not caused
  other issues.
- You may notice other issues once changes have been made. This is okay, and is part of the
  development process.
- Ensure that the pull request will be able to be merged upstream to the live site before you
  approve it.

### 8. Approve the pull request

Once all the requested changes have been made, approve the pull request using the following template
in the comment of the approving review:

Ensure while doing peer reviews that you also follow the
[Planner Board Etiquette](/products/splashkit/08-planner-board) for
moving tasks through the process.
