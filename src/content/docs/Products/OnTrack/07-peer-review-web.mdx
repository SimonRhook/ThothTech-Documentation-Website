## Introduction on how to do a peer review within the Ontrack Web Dev Team

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Peer reviews are essential for maintaining high-quality code in the Ontrack team project.
- The Peer-Review Checklist is **required** for every review to ensure consistency.
- Peer-Review Prompts are **optional** but serve as a resource to guide discussions.
- The goal is to verify code quality while fostering collaboration and improvement.

</Aside>

In Ontrack, peer reviews are a vital process to ensure code quality, maintainability, and
consistency across the website development project. Every pull request (PR) must follow the
Peer-Review Checklist, which checks for key factors like functionality, code readability, and
documentation.

Additionally, the Peer-Review Prompts serve as a conversation starter for reviewers, encouraging
collaboration while allowing for a thorough and constructive review process.

## OnTrack Peer-Review Prompts

Use these prompts to guide discussions and ensure high-quality code contributions:

- **Type of Change**: Is the PR correctly identifying the type of change (bug fix, new feature,
  etc.)?
- **Code Readability**: Is the code well-structured and easy to follow? Could better comments,
  names, or organization improve it?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code modular and easy to maintain? Does it introduce any technical
  debt?
- **Code Simplicity**: Are there redundant or overly complex parts of the code that could be
  simplified?
- **Edge Cases**: Does the code account for edge cases? What scenarios might cause it to break?
- **Test Thoroughness**: Does the testing cover all edge cases and failure paths? Are there enough
  tests to ensure code reliability?
- **Backward Compatibility**: Does the change break any existing functionality? If so, is backward
  compatibility handled or documented?
- **Performance Considerations**: Could this code impact performance negatively? Can it be optimized
  while maintaining readability?
- **Security Concerns**: Does this change introduce any security risks? Is input validation handled
  properly?
- **Dependencies**: Are new dependencies necessary? Could they conflict with existing libraries?
  Could this functionality be achieved without new dependencies?
- **Documentation**: Is the documentation clear and thorough enough for new developers to
  understand? Does it cover API or external interface changes?

## Review Guidelines for Specific File Types

### `.mdx` Files

- **Content Accuracy**: Ensure that the content is clear and accurate. Double-check for any errors
  in documentation or guides.
- **Frontmatter**: Ensure the frontmatter (`title`, `description`, etc.) is correctly filled out.
- **Component Usage**: Verify that components like `LinkCard` or `CardGrid` are used appropriately
  within `.mdx` files.

### `.css` Files

- **Consistency**: Check alignment with the **Styling Guide** and consistent use of variables (e.g.,
  colors, fonts, spacing).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure animations respect user preferences, and contrast ratios meet **WCAG 2.1
  AA** standards.
- **Naming Conventions**: Verify CSS class names follow consistent patterns.

### `.jsx`/`.tsx` Files

- **Functionality**: Validate that interactive components (e.g., forms, sliders) work as expected
  and meet task requirements.
- **Performance**: Identify unnecessary re-renders or performance concerns.
- **Code Style**: Ensure compliance with **React/JSX** best practices and linting rules.

### `.astro` Files

- **Structure**: Verify page/component structure aligns with **Astro standards**.
- **Reusability**: Look for repetitive code that could be refactored into reusable components.
